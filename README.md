# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION-AND-EFFICIENT-USE-OF-FERTILIZERS
Agriculture is crucial for India's economy, but it faces various challenges like selecting the right crop to grow and ensuring food security. To improve agricultural productivity and help farmers make better decisions, we propose using machine learning algorithms to predict crop types and recommend suitable fertilizers based on soil composition. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to predict crop yields. The system utilizes historical agricultural data, including factors such as climate, soil conditions, and crop varieties, to train predictive models. Additionally, the system provides recommendations for the most suitable fertilizers based on the predicted yield and crop type, aiming to enhance productivity while minimizing resource wastage. Through this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture practices, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and achieve higher crop yields in a sustainable manner.
